    "ground_truth = \"all right  in this video we're gonna focus on in this particular pathophysiology topic  we're going to focus on the clinical aspects of cancer or  you know  basically just talking about what cancer is  how it develops  and some a lot of terminology that's related to this  and then from here  we're gonna talk about clinical signs of cancer  so basically  with this video  i'm gonna focus more on the first three bullet points because probably by the time i'm done with these three  there won't be a lot of time left  i'll have loaded you with quite a bit of information  and so i'm going to save the clinical signs of cancer and  um  risk factors for the follow up video to this  so  like i said for so we're going to focus on  um  have a heavy review  our introduction into terminology  and in the process of that  i'll cover what cell differentiation is  and by this point in time  you know what differentiation is  anyway  remember  whenever you see that term differentiate  um you know  if you've learned this term for me  you've always heard me say  think of this  a specialization  now  that's important because you have to look at the side of her makeup of of tumors and figure out how specialized are different  or were they are  and we'll talk more about that  and then it's very important to understand  the difference is between malignant  benign and malignant tumors and how they behave and obviously do diagnostically  this is important  and then we'll end the presentation by looking at some visual examples of  um  of benign versus malignant tumors  all right  so let's  uh  introduce this first  so when learning about cancer  i mean  you're learning about the number one killer of human beings on the planet  i mean  nothing kills more people than cancer  i mean  you know  there  i mean  as you know  there's lots of infections out there  there's lots of accidents  you know  i mean  you know  humans kill each other all the time  animals  other animals kill us  but in the end  like i said  cancer is the number one killer of people  and  you know  a big reason for that is just because yet  you know  one thing you have to understand is that when you think about cancer tumor development  i mean a big part of of of this is my tosis  all right  and what i like to call my tosis gone wrong  okay  my tosis has gone wrong because in many instances  cancer is as inevitable as the process of my tosis itself  you know that  are that that many cells of our body are my tonically active  dividing all the time  and  um  and the more cells air dividing  replicating themselves  making genetic copies of themselves  the higher the chance of the old that errors can occur that can cause tumors to develop  and then if we expose ourselves too hazardous environments  all right  that really  you know  wreak havoc or or hinder that cell cycle  we further increase the chance of developing tumors or cancers and so on  all right  so that's something you have to bear in mind is that cancer is a very prominent part of life  that's why it it does take so many people  has acknowledge is the same  as bad as it is  talk about  that's just one of the unfortunate facts of life  all right  and basically the first  the first thing you have to understand is this term neoplasms  all right  so basically  when you're thinking of the term neoplasms  um  basically  you know that neo all right  neo means new  all right  and when you think a plasm think of tissue growth  all right  when you think of when you see that term plasm think tissue growth  so what we're literally saying here  um is the neoplasms the new tissue growth  all right  and that is basically what a tumor is  all right  a tumor is a massive tissue that has developed or originated in another organ  all right  so i mean and and and these can occur potentially anywhere in the body  all right  uh  you know  in the brain and the liver and the long's and the stomach and the intestines  all right  and connective tissue spaces of the body within lymph nodes  all right  anywhere were tumor develops  that is a neoplasm  right  it's a new tissue growth  all right  and these new tissue growths can either be benign or they can be malignant  all right  a neoplasm or a tumor that is benign  that's typically a little bit better of a word to see  because that because basically when you see a tumor is benign  you're basically saying that it's slow growing that it's ah  it's a their makeup is very original or as close to the  you know  word  the tissue it originated from  and the and the suffix oma  all right is a term is basically use when describing benign tumors  so  for example  if someone develops an adenoma  all right in adenoma is  um  is basically remember what adeno means number  medical terminology one  oh  one  all right  an adenoma  you know  add  you know  adeno means gland  okay  so basically  someone hasn't if someone is diagnosed with an adenoma  what you're saying is is they've got a benign tumor in a particular gland  and obviously the the the terminology is going to be a lot more specific than that  what  you get the picture  all right  so  um  where someone could develop a lipoma  all right  just the massive fat  all right  bunch of fat cells that are growing a little out of control  all right  so and then saying that like  for example  lipoma's are not typically that harmful  not every tumor that a person develops is going to be horribly  life threatening is gonna mean the end of the world  in many cases  these  you know  these these benign masses can be relatively easily route  and in many cases  they can't  all right  we'll talk more about that in a little bit  now  um  now we think of the term cancer  now  cancer obviously  is a very important clinical term  and but cancer is a word that i think has thrown  all are thrown around just a little too liberally out their  um their loosely or however you want to say it  but basically  cancer is a word that's used to describe malignant neoplasms or malignant tumors  all right  now we and and then that's where carson oh comes in  all right  so basically  we're seeing that if we if you see that word carcino in a term i'm someone's chart  um  or in a book or where we see it  what we're seeing here is that that neoplasm of that tumor is cancerous  so if someone has an added no carcinoma  all right  so  basically  member  add no gland oma tumor and carcino cancerous  so what we're seeing here is that  um  you know  malignant tumors  cancerous tumors  that's ah  that's a diagnosis you don't want to receive  all right  because these are the tumors that grow out of control  these are the ones that are invasive that spread into and through other tissues  these are the ones that cause a lot of damage  all right  um  then obviously  the later you catch these malignant neoplasms  the's cancer is neoplasms obviously the lower of the chances of survival  that's why for certain  you know  there there are certain screenings that can be done  you know  we do a lot of self checks on herself there  a certain a certain age is you start getting tested for  um  certain things you like mammograms  prostate checks  males and females doing their old self checks and so on  all right  now these malignant tumors  these are the ones that are capable of metastasizing and basically metastases this it's an easy term to understand  basically  what we're saying here's were saying that this malignant tumor or it is malignant neoplasm this spreading  all right  spreading  and i'm going to talk more about spread in a little bit  but basically  for now  that's what you have to understand when you receive the word metastases or metastasize  all right  we're seeing you know that that's not a word that's used to describe a benign tumor  all right  that is that that no metastases is you specifically for  uh  malignant tumors  all right  now you're probably wondering  well  how do you tell if a tumor is malignant or benign  all right  how do you tell if it's if it's a malignant or benign  and a big part of that is  well  you know  the diagnostic process of this is first off of patients  they're they're typically i'm not going to talk about these in depth in this video or really much at all  but they're they're very common signs of symptoms there that are typical of the cancers  like  you know  people developing tumors like pain  bleeding  anemia  weakness  loss of appetite and so on  all right  and then  basically  once you as as a practitioner  start putting those pieces of the puzzle together  and you start figuring out did okay  look  they've  um they're  you know  they they there's a good chance they may have ah  particular tumor or cancer developing somewhere  then  um  odds are you're probably gonna have to do some scanning  all right  and then if you see the mass  you know whether it's  you know  ultrasound  ct scans  whatever you have to do  depending on where you think the tumor is located and so on  all right  um  then if it's a  you know  obviously get to it  then you biopsy the tumor  remember  biopsy is when you just when you remove ah sample of tissue from the patient and then you analyze it  you study it  all right  and then basically  when you take a look at this  but nine tumors are gonna have cells that are highly differentiated  meaning they're gonna look  they're gonna look a lot like they're gonna look very specialized  they're gonna look almost exactly like the tissue that the tumor originated  it were as a malignant tumor  the cells are going to look very bizarre  alien  they're they're not gonna look anything like the  like  the original tumor that  um  that the  uh you know that that the master the neoplasm was found in  and we'll and we'll see some visual examples of that\"\n",
