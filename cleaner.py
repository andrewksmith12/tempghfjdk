transcript = "My name is Tracy Balboni. I am a physician who works in radiation oncology. I'm also palliative care trained. I work at the Brigham and Women's Hospital as well as the Dana Farber Cancer Institute. And there I'm the clinical director of what's called the Supportive and palliative radiation Oncology Service, which is a service that's dedicated to caring for patients with advanced cancers using radiation therapy to treat their cancers. I knew fairly early on that I was interested in cancer care and uh it was actually some experiences that I had early in my training that kind of really drove home to me that my sense of calling was to be caring for patients with advanced cancers, meaning incurable cancers. And one of those was within my internship when I was only a few months in. So very early in my training. Soon after having finished medical school working very long hours uh and I was caring for a young gentleman with metastatic esophageal cancer and he was he was just experiencing terrible suffering from his cancer. And at one point he kind of angrily said to me, you know, if I knew it was going to be like this, I would have shot myself. And he said it was such uh he meant it. And uh and with such suffering on every level he was suffering physically emotionally, spiritually. And and I knew in that moment, I mean, it wasn't just that I was a very inexperienced physician at that point, only a few months into my internship that was causing a suffering. I knew it was the whole system of care around him that was not able to actually address what was really going on for this man, everything from the physical to the emotional, the spiritual. And so his experiences like that, that drove home to me that there is such a need to care for people well in that setting. And interestingly, so my husband, Michael Balboni was going through his doctoral training and theology at the same time. And so we would, you know, I talk about my experiences in my early medical training, he would talk about his experiences with his theological classes and we would see how our worlds, we're talking about much of the same things. And yet there was this incredible gulf chasm between the two and I never, never, ever met. And that actually prompted me during my internship. Later in my internship, I had very a few weeks of elective time meaning as opposed to the long hours on uh you know, on the various clinical floors, I was allowed to kind of pick what I would do and typically people choose something as uh sleep conducive as possible because you're typically so so uh sleep deprived but but you know, in an outpatient setting, like outpatient oncology, outpatient cancer care where patients are just coming in for appointments, not being seen in the inpatient setting. So I had two weeks of this elective time. And um and I asked the people in my internship overseeing the internship if I could shadow chaplains and learn about what they do, shadow them on the floor, see how they what happens as they visit patients. I hadn't, even though I was now several months into my internship, I actually hadn't been in the same room with a chaplain seeing a patient. And and and my conversations with with Michael had really prompted my questions about how does spirituality interface with someone's experience with an illness. And so, uh so they granted me my request, which was sort of, you know, really amazing on their part that they were willing to do to let me do this. And they asked me to do a project, and the project was to do sort of an overview of the literature regarding um spirituality and the experience of illness. So I shadowed the chaplains. It was an amazing experience. It was just such a different lens into uh into the medical setting, into the experience of patients and their families. Uh and uh and then at the end of that, a couple of weeks, I did a presentation to uh not only the chaplains, but also uh folks within the Internal medicine um group on the role of spirituality with an illness. And that was my first kind of delving into that literature, and ultimately was my first step towards beginning to do research examining spirituality and the experience of illness. So radiation oncology is a field within oncology that is uh using radiation as a therapeutic technique to treat cancers locally. So it's used both uh in the curative setting to treat patients curative li uh pertinent to what I do, I'm typically treating patients with advanced cancers, meaning that their their cancers have spread, they have metastatic disease. And radiation therapy is actually a wonderful tool to help patients to live better with their advanced cancer. And radiation is used to control disease where it might spread uh in otherwise cause uh problems such as uh an area of metastasis compressing on the spine, um compressing the spinal cord, causing pain, causing loss of neurological function, for example, the person's ability to walk. So radiation is used as a as a therapeutic technique to treat areas of disease so that patients can live is normally um as possible as well as possible with their cancer. As well as being used, curative lee the way to describe how radiation is given is its most analogous to uh getting an X ray. So it's actually there's a variety of different ways in which radiation therapy is delivered most commonly. It's delivered via external beam radiation therapy, which is where um the radiation is uh is generated outside of the person and then delivered into the body. And that's the most common form of radiation therapy that I use. And those um what are called linear accelerators, which are the machines that uh that are used to create highly can formal beams of radiation therapy um are on an arm. So the person isn't necessarily inside a tube or um uh or inside a doughnut, which would be um typically what a CT scan um uses their. Oftentimes, just lying on a table with this machine on an arm that's moving, moving around them. That's the most common type. There are certain types of radiation therapy that are uh that are delivered with more of like a ct scanner type apparatus. Um but then there's other types of radiation altogether. So, for example, uh implantable forms of radiation therapy where radiation is within seeds typically um uh some form of metal uh and then placed in the body to treat an area an area of cancer prostate breaking therapy is the most common example of that. In other words, it's either generated kind of external to the body and delivered with very sophisticated machines or in an operating room setting placed within the body. Typically on some form of metal, like a prostate breaking therapy seeds, which are these seeds of metal that are that have radiation therapy within them that are placed within the tumor itself. I'm trying to think of a good analogy. So it is the same uh you know, although it's in many ways quite different. It's uh you know, kind of maybe maybe the best kind of thought of what the difference would be is, you know, um you know, Chernobyl would be more like, you know, you you get in a bicycle accident and you fall off your bike and you have all kinds of abrasions and broken bones in your body because it's just the injury goes everywhere as opposed to a highly trained surgeon taking out your appendix. That's the difference, Yes. Both involve cutting various soft tissues and all the rest, but but one is obviously preferable over the other uh because one is highly directed and and where the tissue injury is happening. And so so radiation therapy is using hi technologies um particularly given the advances in radiology, the ability to image various parts of the body. And then using the property of radiation therapy which is that with external beam it actually doesn't deposit its dose right away. It actually has to travel a distance and body before it deposits its dose. So it's using um that property of the radiation therapy and then using very computer based technologies to deliver the radiation to create these very con formal uh areas of radiation dose where it treats the tumor. And then even even very highly complex complex shapes of tumors. Um and then quickly falls off so that the normal tissues around around the tumor are spared. And uh and of course radiation interacts with uh with cancer cells by damaging the D. N. A. And ultimately causing cancer cell cancer cell death. So you're taking advantage of that property of the radiation to bring about cancer cure to the site that you're treating. So so anyways, the the that that to me is more of a like a precision surgeon, uh you know, removing some part of the body as compared to a uh an injury that sort of inadvertently kills and harms all kinds of tissues, which would be more analogous to what Chernobyl caused and patients. So there's a whole electro magnetic spectrum, so radio waves, um very low frequency, uh you know, they are at one spectrum, your cell phone is around there, your microwave. Uh and uh and then, you know, as you get increasing frequency, you get eventually to ultraviolet light, for example. So from the sun where it's uh the energy of it is sufficient only to penetrate our skin. Hence that's why you only get a sunburn. It's not like you get a deep burn from radiate from radiation from the sun because it only can penetrate so deep. Um And then you get to uh to energies that actually can penetrate the body, like what's used for an X ray, it can interact with the DNA of cells. But typically uh that's quite minimal. And of course you still want to reduce uh X ray exposure particularly to young people because it does have a degree of cancer risk. It's very small. But in large populations you can see that risk many many years down the road. And then ultimately as the energy increases, you get to mega voltage uh forms of uh electro magnetic radiation which is therapeutic radiation that's used for radiation therapy where um the now the the energy can be delivered to very small structures like to double stranded DNA cause double stranded DNA breaks. And ultimately that DNA damage results in um cell injury and cell death, particularly to cells that are rapidly dividing, Which case in point would be your cancer cells which are rapidly dividing, so they're more vulnerable to that. So it's actually all along the same spectrum. Your radio radio waves all the way up to radio wave. Cell phones, microwaves, you know, ultraviolet radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X rays, uh two mega voltage radiation that's used for therapeutic purposes, but all with very different effects on the body. But but below, particularly below ultraviolet light. The things like the radio radio waves or microwaves, et cetera, are not sufficient to cause DNA damage. So aren't considered harmful cell phones the same. A variety of different research. Uh studies have been done to uh to examine the role of spirituality within coping. It's uh it's one of the primary ways that individuals cope with uh with a serious illness. And uh and it also is critical to preserving individuals quality of life in the setting of a serious illness. So, for example, I'm thinking of one study where examining patients with advanced cancers, where patients who were relying upon their spirituality to cope with illness um were preserved their quality of life better uh in the setting of high symptom burden. So, um you know, those that had lower kind of lower spirituality, lower measures of religious coping, spiritual coping when they had high symptom burden, it created greater documents in the individuals quality of life. So it's really suggesting that that coping is really a way by by which people are absorbing the stresses of illness. And and just translating that research to actual, like, for example, my own experience and caring for patients. It's really one spirituality which very broadly defined as the way ways by which we find transcendent meaning, purpose and value typically centered on what is known to be sacred in our lives. And it's uh, if we can experience a stressor in our lives no matter what it is, but certainly serious illnesses, a stressor and and integrated into a sense of who we are in a transcendent way. Um, it allows us to preserve our sense of meaning, value, purpose, identity despite the fact that you're experiencing something as stressful as a serious illness. Now, that's not to say that some folks have a threat to their spirituality or they have spiritual struggle as a result of their of their illness. And that certainly happens as well. You can see individuals really having spiritual suffering because the fact that they are dealing with a serious illness creates uh, spiritual questions, concerns and needs, et cetera, that aren't resolved orb and so certainly can also be a place for spiritual struggle, but it also can be a place for for flourishing. I've seen individuals who, despite the fact that they are experiencing an illness that is, you know, step by step destroying them physically, are actually growing and flourishing spiritually and emotionally, despite despite their illness in the face of their illness and often times they'll say it's because of their illness and they'll actually express a degree of gratitude for what their illness has brought them even despite despite that suffering. And in that sense, it's clearly within medicine, we were saying how much it's been neglected in the practice of medicine, medicine is very focused on the material body. But because individuals, especially a broadly defined sense of spirituality, everyone, especially in the setting of a serious illness uh has questions, has ways in which their spirituality is functioning. You know, whether the atheist or the very devout catholic, no matter what, there are some ways in which one sense of central identity are come into play and for medicine to ignore that critical aspect of who someone is is missing is clearly missing a whole dimension of what it means to be, to be human. And fortunately increasingly, within medicine, there is a recognition that health isn't just physical, that health is physical, emotional, social and spiritual, but of all of those, I think the spiritual dimension of illness is the one that medicine has the longest way to go as far as beginning to understand how to integrate, incorporate together with addressing the other aspects of an individual's health. I knew a sense of calling to caring for people with serious illness. Uh, you know, I share the story of the gentleman with esophageal cancer who is suffering terribly from his disease and it was experiences with patients like that that uh you know, I felt, you know, I think we're all sort of uniquely suited given gifts uh to do certain things in life. Uh and and I knew both because of the sense of burden that I felt for those circumstances, like something needs to be done. And I also knew that I had been so equipped with the passion that's necessary to to delve into this area and then also equipped with the training et cetera to be able to um do the research, um to care for those patients etcetera. So, you know, number one, my my faith has played a role in simply being that it is my calling. I feel uh like the Lord has given me a given me that passion gifted me with the with the resources that I need to be able to do to do this work. And certainly my understanding of, of caring for the sick is that it's a critical part of as a christian of who who I am as a christian to be um embracing and loving those who are vulnerable, vulnerable and people that people are, you know, there's many forms of vulnerability in our world but certainly experiencing uh a life threatening illness is a is an extreme form of vulnerability and loving people cherishing them for who they are. Um in the setting of that vulnerability is uh I know as a tremendous calling and a gift and a privilege from uh from the Lord. I mean first and foremost, as you know, my primary training is as a a radiation oncologist, a scientist, I I think science and the body and is amazing. It's an ordered creation which has ordered um ways of bringing about healing and that is what I'm trained in. I'm trained in those orders, ordered ways of bringing about healing. And I received medicine as a gift from the Lord. I receive our minds that are able to understand the science of our world and certainly of our bodies and have disease also as a gift. And so I first and foremost view uh medicine and caring for the sick as as an outflow of God's creation and and and is the primary way of of healing people. Uh And and it is amazing to see for example, someone you know, with just something as simple as a debilitating lee, painful uh area of cancer in a bone. And I treat it and the person has no pain and is able to go on walks and pick up their grandchildren. And I mean that to me is a is a is a beautiful way of bringing about healing. And there's myriad ways in which we we by understanding our world by understanding the created order, bring about healing to our patients. So I believe that is first and foremost, and I I I do believe in miraculous healings. I've certainly seen kind of unexplainable by scientific means, ways in which people's disease has has subsided, allowing for uh certain things to occur. So, for example, you know, someone's disease trajectory suddenly, uh you know, you think that they're gonna die very quickly and yet they have this goal to walk their daughter down the aisle. I can think of a patient with this very story, and I think, oh my goodness, they're never going to make it. But this this person, their disease just seemingly miraculously just stops and they're able to actually reach that, reach that goal. And I, and, you know, and I would say that because ultimately, you know, it's so easy to have our minds framed around our our material existence. And so we tend to focus on the miracle of bringing about more material existence. But ultimately, I think miraculous healings, uh, they need to have, they should point to our existence beyond this world. And so I don't go about seeking. I mean, of course, I always want my patients to be miraculously healed and I hope hope for that. Um, but my understanding and expectation is that that's only going to be happening in whatever form, as it ultimately brings about a healing, that's going to be an eternal form of healing, because that's the only all of us, Even if I can prolong, even if someone's cancer that's, you know, advanced cancer incurable suddenly all disappears, The person is going to one day die. Um, and but there is an eternal existence that will never die. And so where healing happens, whether it's from biological means, ordered means or whether via miraculous means, it is 2.2 the ultimate healer. And I believe that that both do you know, particularly people that care for cancer patients. I think there is a in understanding that that's that people spirituality in whatever shape is an important part of their experience. And so I I think people think it's a little strange that I would do the research work that I do too kind of elucidate the role of spirituality and illness. But at the same time there's an understanding of Uh huh. Yes. This is a key aspect of so many patients that we care for. It's hard to ignore. So I think I was I remember being very afraid of going along this path. In fact, my original plan going into radiation oncology was that I was going to be a more of a bench researcher, what's called translational research, which is kind of bringing bench research with bench research to clinical setting, being someone that kind of plays that role. And so I even had a project that I was going to be doing. And uh uh and ultimately after this sort of experience over the course of internship, uh I knew that my calling was to do research work at the intersection of spirituality and serious illness. And uh and I was very afraid to tell my residency program where I was doing my training and radiation oncology, of my decision to make this change, particularly because it was so odd. So there's a lot of fear and I think, you know, some of that was because I thought that they wouldn't be receptive to the type of work that I was aiming to do. And amazingly, once I finally got up the, the courage to let them know that I wanted to make this switch away from what would be sort of more conventional for radiation oncology training to something that was fairly unconventional. Um there was there was an amazing amount of um support and receptivity, I think within medicine there's many people who understand how are care is so technical that we can miss the bigger picture of what it means to be human. And so for some even real encouraging um encouragement of me to pursue this route, um not that they haven't been nay Sayers that definitely have been plenty of naysayers who think that what I'm doing is a waste of time. But I was surprised by the number of people that were very supportive and and I think that comes from kind of a visceral sense that that this aspect of this human aspect of medicine is missing and it needs work and it needs to be developed. You know, I do work in in spirituality and the experience of serious illness. And yet at the same time, I also do sort of very technical research work on the use of radiation therapy is a very sort of high technology technique to in particular to manage disease within the spine, particularly because the spine is so such a critical aspect of um people's quality of life, again, paying their ability to walk, feel, etcetera. And I and I think it's I have found that it's been critical to have both a grounding in more physical technical aspects of care, together with with holding and embracing and doing research that examines the other aspects of what it what it means to experience an illness and the intersection of spirituality and illness being the primary the primary way that I that I do, that some other places of intersection that I think have been important uh are that although I've done most of my research work on spirituality and serious illness, I work a lot with, for example, Tyler Vander Wheel at the Harvard School of Public Health. Um and his focus on is on religion, spirituality and health. So ways in which one spirituality, one of the communal expressions of spirituality in the form of religious communities, contribute to health and to flourishing. And uh and I found that that there are many ways in which the role of spirituality and serious illness kind of reflects ways in which it interfaces with health. But there's also amazing, I think, new ways of understanding human well being, human flourishing by examining its role in healthy healthy populations. And so some work I'm beginning to do is is actually expanding beyond the setting of serious illness and thinking about things like, you know, what about the primary care setting uh and issues like mental health or prevention of substance abuse, substance uh use disorders or um or things like that, which I think are other ways in which um individual spirituality, but also communal forms of spirituality in the form of religious communities can play very important roles, informing not only the health of individuals, but even the health of larger, larger communities. Yeah, it's amazing to see the human spirit and how. And you also see one thing I'm I'm constantly reminded of is we as much as I, you know, we know that we're gonna die. It's it's, you know, we forget and we don't see that reality, and um and I see in my patients who are dealing with the reality through their illness, of the fact that they're dying, the ways in which it helps you. Yes, it causes terrible suffering, but it also um, causes you to keep in mind what really matters and keeps the questions in the forefront of your mind is what is the purpose of my life, What is my life about what is actual, what is actually meaningful about what we do day to day? And I feel like that I need that daily reminder personally. I feel like many of us do because we can lose sight of that that which is so meaningful, what that which is most meaningful so easily and get caught up in things that aren't, that aren't meaningful anyway. But yeah."
