 Welcome to today's web chat on breast cancer. Thank you for joining us. My name's Ed Bottomley, I'm gonna be your host for today's chat and we have our two panelists with us. We're gonna meet them in a moment but first I wanted to talk about a few housekeeping items. You can submit your questions at any time even now for our panelists to answer during the Q and A portion of today's chat. Questions can be submitted by commenting on this video, but please know that if you do comment your name or your profile name will be visible to others participating. Now if you prefer a more anonymous option you can send a private message to us on Facebook or on Twitter. If you can't stay for the whole chat or if you want to share the recording of this chat with a friend, a video of the chat in it's entirety will be available on our Michigan Medicine Facebook Twitter and YouTube pages, as well as our Rogel Cancer Center social pages too. So now on to our panelists if you could introduce yourselves.  Hello, I'm Sofia Merajver. I'm a medical oncologist at the Rogel Cancer Center and I run the high-risk clinic for the individuals at increased risk for breast and ovarian cancer.  Hi, I'm Jacqueline Jeruss and I'm a breast surgical oncologist also at the Rogel Cancer Center and I am the Director of the Breast Care Center.  Thank you so much both for joining us. Let's jump right in with our questions and we have them segmented to different topics. First we have detection and diagnosis. First question we have up. Why do they keep changing the age for starting to get mammograms?  So I'm happy to address that. I think that to try to be as clear as possible at the University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center we recommend the guidelines that are put forward by the American Cancer Society as well as the American College of Radiology which would suggest that a baseline mammogram be obtained between the ages 35 and 40 and after age 40 every year with the understanding that every other year is also an option based on a conversation that a patient would have with their physician about their familial risk and other risk components. I think it's important to state that at the University of Michigan 20% of our patients cases are diagnosed under the age of 50 so with that information in hand we strongly recommend that patients begin their mammogram at age of 40 and I think that's been a long standing recommendation.  Thank you, anything to add, Dr. Merajver?  Well, thank you I totally agree. Furthermore, there are times where it's appropriate to start earlier, such as individuals who have a particularly high risk situation like carrying a mutation to a particular cancer susceptibility gene or a special family history structure we may recommend earlier, but for the person at average risk we very much recommend starting around 40.  Thank you. Thank you both for that. Our next questions we have up. How important is self-examination and when should one start it? How does one do a self-exam?  So I think that self-exam has become more controversial as of late as it sort of lost it's advocacy from some of the more prominent cancer organizations but we advocate for self-exam for patients because I truly stand by the fact that I think the patient is their own best advocate and so we would really want a patient to feel comfortable with their bodies and to know their bodies and I think this goes beyond issues associated with breast health to a global sense of wellness that we would want each patient to feel confident about. That being said I think that once the patient feels comfortable with themselves and their bodies to examine themselves once a month typically mid-month, the same time every month and feel confident that if that have any concerns or questions about changes in their exam that they can come forward and speak to a physician at the University of Michigan to help better define what their concern might be.  Yes.  Great and the next questions that we have up. My doctor has asked me to come back for a second mammogram, does that mean I have breast cancer?  I think that's a great question and certainly something that creates a significant amount of stress for patients when it happens and so I think the best way I can answer this is by putting the numbers out and I had the chance to discuss this question with my colleagues Dr. Colleen Neal who is the Director of Breast Imaging at the university of Michigan. And so here are the facts, about 1000 patients come in for screening of those 1000 100 will probably be called back for a second assessment and I think that that probably means that in a patient's lifetime the likelihood is very high that this will happen and it really has to do more with the ability to obtain the type of imaging projections that are needed that may not be attainable on a first screening assessment. Important to state though of those patients that get called back only two or three of those patients are gonna be diagnosed with cancer so the likelihood of this translating a second call-back likelihood of that translating into a cancer diagnosis is exceedingly low but the likelihood of a call-back in a lifetime is actually quite high, but just to obtain the right amount of pressure so that the imaging can be resolved.  Thank you. Thank you for that. The next questions asks if you can tell them more about a regular mammogram and a 3D one?  Yes, also an excellent question and one that I had the chance to talk about with Dr. Neal, so 2D is really a traditional imaging modality that you would be obtaining if you came to the Cancer Center for a standard screening exam. 3D mammography is distinct and it's what we now understand to be tomosynthesis, if you hear that term being used and the distinction between a 2D and a 3D image is that a 2D image really takes images and specific directions that are stable at the time. A 3D image has more variability and is able to obtain images of the breast in various angles and may help to better define more subtle findings in a patients exam, specifically for patients who potentially are at higher risk or thought to potentially have dense breasts and so I think the other component I want to address is that while 3D imaging is associated with more radiation exposure both the amount of radiation from a 2D imaging exam and a 3D imaging exam is exceedingly low.  Thank you for that. Anything to add Dr. Merajver?  No, I think the 3D images are really a very big advance and they do help detect sometimes hidden structures and so if you're recommended to have a 3D mammogram which we sometimes recommend in our high-risk clinic by all means make sure you go to a Center that offers that.  Thank you for that. The next question, now this is something that you mentioned in your previous answer. How does one know if one has dense breasts?  So this has become a very also intense topic for patients, specifically if they obtain a letter from an imaging center that states that they have dense breasts and so again I think putting numbers to the percentage of patients who may obtain a letter like that. Approximately 50% of patients in the United States will be categorized as having dense breasts and there are four categories of breast density that have to do with extremely dense parenchyma to mostly fatty replaced. So dense breasts are not abnormal they are a component of life that has to do with likely the hormonal environment and the age at which the patient is being studied so that being said if there is a question about breast density that is of concern to the Imager based on a 2D or 3D mammogram imaging can be supplemented through the use of additional targeted ultrasound or potentially MRI if the patient is thought to have other components or risk in their history.  Thank you for that. This next question is a little bit of a broader one. What are the different types of breast cancer?  So, I'll let Dr. Merajver talk about that.  Yes, so breast cancer up until about I would say about 30 years ago we talked about breast cancer essentially as a single disease with maybe some individuals having expression of the estrogen receptor and being typically described as having more of what we call indolent or sort of lazier cancers that don't proliferate so fast and divide so fast and grow fast, but it has been really in the last 15, 19 years where there's been an explosion of our understanding of breast cancer being many, many diseases, so starting with the differentiation the difference between having estrogen receptor expression in the breast cells or not having it and then the expression of other markers that contribute to the development of the cancer itself. Notably the progesterone receptor as the second hormone receptor and then the third one that is really important is a driver, we call it a driver something that encourages the cancer to really not respect boundaries and grow and invade and that's the HER2 gene, H-E-R-2 and that gene is very strong because there are many copies of it in the cancer cell not in the normal cells but in the cancer cell. We can detect that and that's usually a very important driver and it's very important for people to know and that's why that test is done routinely across the board almost everywhere in the world to decide on treatment. So right now we know we have estrogen receptor positive cancers that may or may not express the HER2 gene and then we have some breast cancers a category of it's own, but a very important one where all three of these genes are either low or not expressed at all. And we call those, it's sort of a basket we put them all in a basket called triple negative breast cancer. The truth of the matter is if we have some audience right now who is interested about triple negative breast cancer I really want to say that in triple negative breast cancer we are a little bit today the way we were in normal breast cancer about 30 years ago. We still call it the single category but it turns out that there are probably six to eight to maybe 10, maybe 20 different categories of triple negative breast cancer so we are continuing to do tremendously important research to really understand the biology and why the question is so important is because the treatment depends on these biological characteristics.  Thank you for that, anything to add?  You know I want to stress that I think there was a time in the not to distant past where patients felt that their disease biology was really likely to dictate a specific endpoint but to speak to Dr. Merajver's point. I think we really look at these markers now as an opportunity to implement targeted therapeutics and there's really never been a time that's more exciting than now in research and in translational science and in clinical care for us to take the information that we have been working hard for in the lab and actually exploit it to a patients benefit to obtain targeted therapeutics and so I think it's a time to feel very optimistic about where things stand with breast cancer care.  Yeah, all I would like to add before we leave this topic is there is one type of breast cancer that can't miss mentioning it is the rarest form, only about 2 to 3% of white Caucasian patients have this type of breast cancer and only maybe 4 or 5% of African-Americans have this type it's called inflammatory breast cancer and this is a type of breast cancer that presents with a red, inflamed breast sometimes it has some dimpling of the skin resembling for example the skin of an orange. This is a severe case of breast cancer that needs to be attended and it's extremely treatable and curable if it is caught very soon so patients who present with this rare form who have a sudden onset of redness in the breast they should seek medical attention because it is an urgency and it can become an emergency. And so I wanted to mention it because also this type of breast cancer cuts across all the other receptor types it can be estrogen receptor positive it can be estrogen receptor negative, etc. But the presentation in the breast with the redness and the swelling is very specific, other conditions such as infections can present that way and that's why seeking very prompt medical attention is really important and talking to your doctor if you have that problem about potentially a biopsy the first time you see the doctor just bring it up. If you are listening and you have this problem go to your doctor today and bring up the topic of getting a biopsy.  Thank you for bringing that up. Next question that we have what's the screening process with a patient who had bilateral mastectomy with saline implants reconstruction?  So for those patients we traditionally rely on physical exam as the primary screening modality but I do want to take the time to address the recent FDA new advisory that was issued just this past week delineating that patients who have implants saline or silicone should now seek an exam either with ultrasound or MRI, physical exam every five to six years with the understanding as follows that implants are not intended for a lifetime and that they may require maintenance and should be evaluated at least every five to six years.  Thank you for that. We have another question that's come in. If my breasts hurt even when I'm not on my period does that indicate anything?  I want to stress first and foremost that breast pain is something that's very common and Dr. Merajver and I see patients with breast pain every week in our clinical practices that being said it can be quite alarming and concerning and if you have concern about your exam it's very important to come in and be evaluated to make sure your imaging is up to date and then also have a physical exam. I also want to stress that breast pain can be managed and there are many different modalities that we recommend in the Breast Center that have to do with caffeine modification of intake the amount of exercise upper body strengthening the use of a supportive bra that all can help to contribute to the decrease in the incidents or the experience of breast pain.  Thanks for that. The next question a little bit of a change of topic. How is male breast cancer detected?  Well male breast cancer is relatively rare but it does happen and unfortunately it turns out that over the years it's been documented that men tend to ignore little bumps and lumps in their breast and they really shouldn't because a male has really not very many reasons to have bumps and lumps in the breast in contrast to a woman where during the reproductive years especially close to their periods that their breasts can become more lumpy and women are accustomed to feeling that in their breast self-exam which I completely agree with Dr. Jeruss we should encourage women to do so that they know their bodies better and they are able to detect differences. Well the same holds true for men and in men detected very easily because there is less tissue, it's easier and then they do nothing about it so if you're a man listening in or if you are a woman and you are concerned about a male person in your life who maybe having an abnormality something that he has shown you or you have felt, do not be shy and encourage him to seek attention because sadly many men are detected eventually are diagnosed eventually much later than they should have been. They delay diagnosis. They just ignore a little bump that's not hurting and male breast cancer is almost never painful because there is again a lot less tissue so there's no pressure or less likely to be pressure. Once it's diagnosed we compare the extent of disease we call that stage in cancer. The prognosis is almost the same although again sometimes they delayed diagnosis causes the cancer to have become maybe a little more advanced or aggressive and so we are concerned about that and so encourage everyone who feels a lump to have it checked by you healthcare provider as soon as possible.  Just to the frame the context though I think it's important that we understand what the incidence is and just like the incidence of inflammatory breast cancer that was just mentioned by Dr. Merajver is a great concern. The incidence is very rare we talking about just about 3000 cases of inflammatory cancer that are diagnosed ever year and a similar number of male breast cancers are diagnosed every year, in fact about 2600 cases are expected to be diagnosed in men this year of breast cancer. So I want patients to understand that the risk of being diagnosed with these findings is low but just the same what we want more than anything else is to address a diagnosis at the soonest possible time point so awareness is so foundational to understand these problems and to feel comfortable coming in, seeking help from a physician to be provide clarity for whatever it is that concerns you.  I cannot think of any exception to the rule that treating cancer at the earliest possible time is better.  Agree.  So not just for breast cancer, but for any cancer. So bumps and lumps try to not ignore anywhere in the body.  Yeah.  Thank you. Next questions we have up. Does a dimple in your breast always indicate breast cancer?  I would say that we want to see patients who have new changes, whatever they may be in their breast exam, but a dimple more than likely is an indication of potentially the just normal maturation process of the breast, but it would be a finding that would indicate to us that a further workup is necessary and would be very much an appropriate reason to come in and seek additional physical exam care and imaging care.  Thank you. Thank you for fielding all these questions. We're about a third of the way through now and we're gonna change topic onto treatment options. What are treatment options for breast cancer?  Well do you want to get started?  I'm gonna say the broad overview tends to be that we offer our patients surgery, systemic therapy, which would include chemotherapy anti-hormonal therapy, bioimmune therapy other targeted immune therapies as well and radiation and so those are the three big standard approaches that we use to implement the fight against breast cancer when a patient is newly diagnosed and I think Dr. Merajver was gonna talk specifically about our systemic treatment options.  Sure, I mean not everyone, but many patients will require treatment beyond surgery. Some patients are cured with surgery alone depending on the type of surgery most patients that do not have the whole breast removed will also require radio therapy so those are some combinations of therapies that some patients with very early cases or very benign biology, so it's still a malignant tumor but the biology's favorable then they might not get the other therapies. Also, some patients for whom there are no other therapies to offer may also just stop at surgery or radiation. Patients who are older adults who have other medical conditions so there are no cookie cutter sort of recommendations for everyone but if somebody's told that you need therapy that goes everywhere in the body I want to take a second here to explain maybe a little more than a second why that is because patients are always puzzled. I have the tumor right here and why do I need something in my bloodstream or why do I need to take a pill where it goes everywhere. A lot of our patients say, "I don't like medicines" and so let me take a minute to explain why it's worth very seriously considering your doctor's advice if they discuss with you why you should take this therapy we call systemic systemic meaning it goes everywhere and the reason for that is that in spite of the amazing skills of the surgeons such as my colleague Dr. Jeruss right here who is an amazing practitioner of surgery.  Thank you.  Yes.  And I feel the same about you.  Well we have to take a minute here to tell the truth. Nonetheless, she cannot know whether a 100,000 cells or 1000 cells or even a million cells have left your tumor before she got to it. It is impossible to know that. A one centimeter tumor, which is a rather small tumor we call that stage one in breast cancer still has right now we estimate a half a billion to a billion cells. Now imagine if you had a billion dollars to yourself would you know exactly where $10,000 are? Maybe you would, but maybe you wouldn't. So that is the situation 10,000 cells could have left your tumor and those are the cells anywhere in the body that maybe they are. I'm not saying they are, they could be. So we want to kill them while they are circulating in your bloodstream and maybe lodging themselves in some organs and they could stay there for many years. So that is the purpose. That is why we as oncologist will suggest fairly strong drugs, let's face it the drugs in cancer are the really strongest drugs we have in all of medicine. I think most doctors in every specialty would agree. So you are going to be treated at a specialized center by doctors who are very experienced using these drugs. You want to get the right drug. You want to get the right dose of the drug for who you are as a person, everything else that's going on and you want to get the right spacing of the drug. We call that intensity, so everybody gets the treatment but it doesn't end the same. The side effects could be different. The drugs that we give you to prevent side effects so you need to go to a specialized center that has experience with your type of breast cancer and so you may get then the therapy. You may sometimes get the chemotherapy before Dr. Jeruss does her surgery because the point is to shrink the tumor maybe but also to find out if your tumor was responsive to that therapy. So there's a lot to be learned by that scenario, we call that scenario neoadjuvant chemotherapy. So after all that therapy many patients also need to take a pill, which is a hormonal anti-estrogen essentially estrogen modulated we call them pills and there are several different types of patients will get different ones and again we talked about the HER2 oncogene the HER2 gene before many patients will then go to one or two drugs against that oncogene if that oncogene is active. So there are all these diversity of treatments and they will all be explained to you if you need them. You should ask all of the questions and there should be a lot of dialogue as to what's expected to happen when you get these therapies but I want to reassure our listeners, our viewers that it is extremely safe to receive therapy for early stage breast cancer. Extremely safe, they are strong drugs of course. Is it going to be a bit of a challenge? Yes. But you and your healthcare team and your support at home will get through it well.  Thank you. Thank you for that very important. Next question we have up. I recently had a lumpectomy for DCIS. Will finish radiation treatment shortly and begin hormone therapy soon. I tested positive for the CHEK2 mutation, C-H-E-K-2 and I've been told I will need yearly mammograms and breast MRIs for quite some time. I have Cochlear implants which complicates but doesn't make MRIs impossible.  So this is a very interesting question and a very patient specific question but I think we could answer on broad terms today but that I do want to be thoughtful about in the sense that as Dr. Merajver so eloquently just stated everybody's treatment plan is now becoming more and more targeted and so that people should believe when they have a diagnosis that they can really experience what is now personalized medicine and so while we may have very thoughtful responses to how we consider CHEK2 mutations. I also want to suggest that there are unique components to every patient that today we cannot necessarily address directly and that will be best managed by a truly personally designed plan. It has a lot to do with not just understanding of the mutation, but the family history that is associated with that mutation as well.  Yes, I'd like to add that a patient who has DCIS or not and I hope this patient is watching I'm definitely addressing you as well whereas I cannot give you medical advice as Dr. Jeruss said, you really ought to consider being evaluated in a clinic that specializes in understanding the CHEK2 and other breast cancer susceptibility genes genes that cause a person to be very prone to breast cancer and CHEK2 is certainly one of them and you deserve that kind of solo evaluation where then your Cochlear implants or any other metal in your body can be sorted out in consultation with our radiologist and the best enhanced screening that is likely to be recommended can be designed for you, so rather than us saying here everyone gets an MRI and a mammogram that would not be good medicine. We need to personalize as Dr. Jeruss said your particular case, but if there are other CHEK2 carriers out there you all deserve a thorough long conversation about other screening modalities that you need because you carry this or other genes because breast is not the only cancer you're at increased risk for so availing yourself for this consultation in a specialized clinic, such as we have at the Rogel Cancer Center we are delighted to see anyone who is within reach. Please be sure to contact us. If you are out of state, anywhere in the country pretty much anywhere in the world we have listserves where we can provide you with a name and a phone number or some contact in your region so please call us we are delighted to assist you.  Thank you both so much for that answer. The next question, can you explain more about genetics and screening and if there's a preferred test?  This is another really exciting time for us to talk about the implications of genetic testing, but also to be I think very thoughtful and intentional about the approaches that are taken. And this why I feel very proud to practice at the University of Michigan where a specialty clinic exists run by Dr. Merajver to address these exact type of questions. To help design the appropriate panel of testing to be implemented for patients who have a family history or cancer history that would indicate that genetic screening would be the appropriate component part of their management and so I think Dr. Merajver you can address some of these things in a more directed way.  Testing is increasing. Certainly awareness of genetic testing in general is increasing. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that certain types of genetic material cannot be patented and therefore it opened the gates for a lot of different enterprises to undertake genetic testing for cancer prone genes. Well, this has evolved over time into what we would kindly call a bit of a chaotic situation but that's what we do in clinic. We put order to the chaos. You can relax. We will talk to you about why we are testing on a single gene or on a panel and what those genes mean and what are the likely outcomes of the test. The problem with many people being tested not in a situation where they are properly informed before the test, we call that pre-test counseling is that they are very shocked when they get their results and then the practitioner who may have ordered the results is often times equally shocked and then all of a sudden we get an urgent call please see this patient and we are delighted to see the patient. However, I think it's ideal for all of us who seek this information and this includes me and everyone right here at the table is to really go from the beginning to a clinic if possible or to a practitioner who really understands what genetic testing is all about and what will be the implications of you so you make an informed decision and the whole process is positive and then you are prepared to make this management decisions such as increased screening or surgery or taking medicines and you are completely prepared for that and going into the test you know that that's an option for the future. So the whole process is beneficial to you and beneficial importantly, I'm sure many of you are asking this question because you are worried about yourself but you are really worried about children or siblings or other family members.  Thank you. Next question we have up. Who should get genetic testing?  So in the same spirit there are a lot of individuals who are now getting genetic testing because it makes a difference in their treatment. And at present pretty much most patients with ovarian cancer who have genetic testing most patients with metastatic breast cancer. I would go as far as to say all patients with metastatic breast cancer. Most patients with metastatic prostate cancer and that's a lot of men with prostate cancer who previously were not being tested. So these breast cancer genes influence other organs as I mentioned before prostate in particular in men also colorectal cancer and so on. So as time goes on we find that it is beneficial in many different patient populations to undergo testing, so talk to your doctor if you are a cancer survivor or you are undergoing cancer treatment right now which makes you a survivor already talk to your doctor about whether you need to consult with a high-risk clinic or consult with your own doctor to begin with whether you should be considering genetic testing. Right now I can't give you specific guidelines because they occupy about 80 pages and everyone will really leave us very quickly if I start reciting them, but the important point is if you are undergoing cancer treatment or you are a cancer survivor talk to your doctor and if you have a family history of breast cancer talk to your doctor.  Thank you. Next question we have up, is immunotherapy available for triple negative breast cancer?  Immunotherapy is available for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer and as we have been saying I think this is a really exciting time in terms of the translation of care that is existing from recent laboratory research into the clinic and so if you're a patient that's diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer and you are interested in learning more about impactive trials and your eligibility for trials coming to a comprehensive cancer center like Michigan would be a place to learn more about how immunotherapy is being brought into the mainstream management for diagnoses such as triple negative breast cancer and HER2 positive breast cancer as well.  Thank you. Are treatment options the same for male breast cancer patients?  Well you know largely we would still suggest that surgery would be the mainstay and then many of the different medical modalities as elaborated on by Dr. Merajver as well, yes. And I think that we just want to really say I think in a broad reaching base and it's that these treatments are very tolerable and we are here to help you and nurture you through the process, so that you'll come to the other side and so again the mainstay remains surgery systemic therapies and radiation therapy but not all patients need all components of that care and so this is why coming in as early as possible being evaluated really is the critical component of coming up with a very appropriate management plan.  Absolutely.  Thank you, the next questions we have. How often do women go for preventative bilateral mastectomy?  So this is a very interesting and somewhat controversial topic and what we know is that there are many reasons why patients have been more interested in having bilateral mastectomy's to date. A lot of this has to do with information that has become more readily available through modalities like the internet but I think it's important to mention that as we sit here today we have not been able to demonstrate an endpoint from survival or from a treatment standpoint for taking away a healthy breast for removing a healthy breast outside of specific parameters that have directly to do with high-risk family history and a known mutation that would be identified by Dr. Merajver in the Breast Care Center.  Exactly.  It's important that we frame and understand why we make the recommendations that we do and we also recommend we recognize the limits of what we can do surgically for patients and this is why each of the decisions to undergo surgery, especially prophylactic surgery needs to be carefully considered in the context of the patient's known risk risk from family history and the risk that Dr. Merajver can help to accomplish very specifically using very specific instruments that assess these factors so that a patient can be given informed consent about the treatment decisions that she may ultimately make.  Yeah, I like to go further and say just add and emphasize when you have breast cancer you already heard from Dr. Jeruss and myself that there are many different modalities that can be used to cure you and if you have a metastatic disease to control your disease for months, years and hopefully also decades and this happens all the time. Lots of patients, maybe some of our viewers and listeners are survivors for 20, 30 or longer years. So in order to get the optimal, the best treatment you need to have the expertise of all these individuals. If you are going to one practitioner say a surgeon and I'm picking a surgeon because the question is about bilateral mastectomy's. I would pick a different practitioner if it were about chemotherapy but say the question about bilateral mastectomy that is not a decision a single practitioner should be instructing you to pursue that is a discussion that needs to take place in a setting that we call a multidisciplinary clinic, that by the way we take credit at the University of Michigan for having invented in cancer the multidisciplinary tumor board and so if you are a newly diagnosed breast patient please by all means go see your local practitioner whether he or she be a surgeon or your oncologist, but do request information about potentially accessing a multidisciplinary center such as the Rogel Cancer Center so that you really are aware of all the different repercussions and advantages of each option. So if you choose a bilateral mastectomy some of you, a very small percentage of you there will be data that maybe there is a life prolongation by that treatment the vast majority of you you are doing it because you don't want a new diagnosis of a new breast cancer that you don't know if you'll ever get but you don't want the opportunity to have to potentially go through that. If you want to eliminate that situation then the bilateral mastectomy in the hands of a very expert surgeon and reconstruction options are available. So all that you need to explore in the setting of multiple experts serving your case specifically and studying your case, so once that happens then you will make the best informed decision for you.  Agreed.  Thank you both for that. The next topic we're gonna move on to breast surgery. Do I have a choice between a lumpectomy and mastectomy?  So I think that that is also a really important question to address and it also can be sometimes a complicated question because many factors go into making the decisions and the recommendations that we will provide once a patient presents to the Breast Center. I think the most straight forward answer is for a patient who is not known to have a high-risk family history or be a known carrier of a gene that would increase the risk for the development of breast cancer is a lot of the decisions that we make about the best surgical approach have to do with the distribution of disease in the breast and we really want to try to offer patients the surgery that will allow them to reach the goals they are seeking to accomplish that have to do both physically and also the physiological well-being in terms of coping and moving forward but I think the simplest answer is if you're diagnosed early with a small finding that's limited to one quadrant of the breast you will likely be an excellent candidate for lumpectomy. If you're diagnosed with a finding that spans more than one quadrant of the breast is thought to be diffuse or you have multiple findings in the breast mastectomy is often the best approach to take but again it's something that we give incredibly thoughtful and careful consideration to before we make any final surgical plan and if mastectomy is going to be the preferred approach to take we of course want our patients to also have the opportunity to speak with a reconstructive surgeon about how that component of care will also be able to be seamlessly implemented into the treatment strategy.  Thank you. The next question, what are the different types of reconstruction? What is immediate reconstruction versus delayed reconstruction?  So immediate reconstruction would imply that a surgical oncologist would be teaming up with a plastics reconstructive surgeon so that both teams would be present on the day of the planned mastectomy to perform the mastectomy but also immediately implement a component part of reconstruction. And to give the most straight forward answer possible an immediate reconstruction can be performed with placement of a tissue expander/spacer. It can be performed with the immediate implementation of an implant on certain occasions and for certain body types or it can be performed using the patients own tissues from various different parts of the body to become a new breast form for the patient and so that would be the immediate reconstruction approach. For patients who will be having delayed reconstruction for various reasons associated likely with additional treatment modalities that will be needed for the patient to successfully undergo management of her breast cancer that would be when the surgical oncologist would perform the mastectomy alone with the understanding that some point and hopefully not too far down the line in the patient's care plan, the reconstructive surgeon would be able to come in and make a new breast form for the patient.  Thank you both. Next question up. If I have the B-R-C-A gene do I need to have a mastectomy?  Well no, it's just an extension of what we just discussed certainly it's the right option for some people it is often discussed for everyone but what is right for again one individual is not right for another, so we spend a lot of our time with our colleagues and with the patients discussing what's best for the patient depending on the patient's goals. If you are a young person who wants to have children and breastfeed, obviously you want to keep your breasts and various other situations. So there is very good enhanced screening. Enhanced screening doesn't prevent breast cancer it helps prevent a less than favorable outcome because we are diagnosing cancer much earlier but this is a discussion in a multidisciplinary setting but you do not need to have the mastectomy in terms of that being your only reasonable option there are other reasonable options.  Thank you and you know thank you for powering through these questions. There on such a wide variety of topics but we want to push on. We've about 13 minutes left. The next questions we have. How is metastatic breast cancer treated?  I think we want to start off by saying and we'll both discuss this and it's that the expectations for long-term survivorship for patients who have metastatic breast cancer have changed radically in the last 10 to 15 years and so I want this to be a message of optimism and a message of hope that we are doing more now with targeted therapy including immunotherapy as was just brought up in this discussion to prolong the lives of patients who have metastatic breast cancer and we have very specific treatment modalities that we will outline for our patients that have a lot to do with their disease sub-type so that individualized treatment plans will be designed for patients that are foundationally based typically on medicines that the patient can take at home or come to the hospital for short-term infusions for so that their quality of life with this diagnosis can be very high. And so again based on disease sub-type and very much tailored to the patient's disease distribution the opportunities for much longer term survival with metastatic breast cancer I think is more promising now than it's ever been. So I don't know if you want to speak more specifically.  Well I just want to say that you know we are at the goal of treatment in metastatic breast cancer is to make the patient feel better because often times the disease is affecting quality of life either there is pain or tiredness just having cancer in the body of a particular extent just makes people not have a normal quality of life. So that's the number one goal is to restore as much as possible the quality of life that you had before your cancer came back if you were diagnosed at an early stage as most women are in the United States. So that's the number one goal. It turns out that if that is the goal we keep in mind at all times not only do we restore quality, but we get longer and longer and longer life spans as a result because regardless of how much we actually shrink the tumor if we shrink it to the point to where quality is restored many of us at any one point in our lives we can have very good quality living with some cancer in our body. So cancer is not holding us prisoner. We sometimes relinquish our happiness to cancer but if we can be treated with optimism and hope and try to restore the quality of life of the patient and that relationship with the treating doctor is very, very important and the healthcare team and the support at home then we can achieve months, years and decades of extremely good quality. So people are reluctant to call things a cure because we don't want to give false expectations and we always want to be realistic. However, I do believe that we are very close to curing, to calling some people with metastasis cured. I mean how long is long, right? If somebody lives 20 or 30 years and they achieve close to their normal life span I'm not known in the scientific community for being the most overly optimistic person I'm very realistic, but I would call that person a cure. And so I would encourage everyone to seek second opinions and to seek clinical trials. We're doing very exciting research and there are lots of options.  Yeah, for sure.  Yeah, thank you for that. The next topic that we have is fertility. The first question in that topic. If I have the B-R-C-A mutations but not been diagnosed with breast cancer should I look at fertility options?  So I think this might be one of the most important things that we talk about together today. And I think that this is really a unique opportunity again for us to provide information to our patients who may also be mutation carriers about what's available in 2019 and offer them options for informed consent and so I want to speak directly to the fact that if you're a young patient with a mutation who's interested in potentially having a child come to Michigan and be seen by our fertility preservation experts. Our clinic is run specifically by a Dr. Molly Moore of a Cure in Michigan and what she can do is talk about options that exist specifically through o-site cryopreservation using stimulation through standard in vitro fertilization techniques. We can also offer patients embryo cryopreservation with the knowledge now that it's possible for those embryos to then be tested for the presence or absence of the patients known B-R-C-A mutation offering the patient the choice to potentially select for embryos that don't have the mutation so that the experience of being in a family of mutation carriers and carrying that risk of not just breast cancer, but other cancers as Dr. Merajver has so carefully stated could come to an end through the generations and so I just want to state that pre-implantation genetic diagnosis and testing is available now. It's available at Michigan. It's available at centers throughout the United States and the world to offer patients the option to pursue this.  Yes, I have nothing to add. Perfect.  Thank you very much that is an important topic there. The next one we have and thank you for all these questions that are coming in. On genetics there isn't a history of breast or ovarian cancer in my family but some family members have had prostate and colon cancer. Does that mean I am at risk for breast cancer?  You could be. - It could.  You could be. Again this is a relatively recently but this is something that in the high-risk clinics and the genetic clinics we have known for many years but recently we have come to understand that depending on the gender distribution some families have a lot of males, some families have a lot of females and no males and so what kind of cancers are more prominent in your family is determined by what gender your relatives are. So if all you have is uncles and they all have prostate cancer you may very well be at increased risk for breast cancer. So family history of cancer is something that is really important to understand. Ask your doctor if you need to be referred to a clinic and a genetic counselor.  I think if you have a concern we want to see you. We want to help frame your concern and categorize your risk so that you can feel comfortable having the knowledge that your concern matches your risk so that you can act appropriately and responsively to whatever that risk may be.  Thank you and I think we have time for another question. What kind of clinical trials do you have?  Well, we have...  A very large variety. - Many, many yes.  Basically being a comprehensive cancer center we have clinical trials ranging from the early detection, imaging studies prevention studies for people who don't have cancer.  We have an outstanding center for radiation therapy where we're really trying to work as a team our group that's run by Dr. Jim Hayman in collaboration with other leading experts in radiation therapy, including the incoming President of the American Society of Clinical Oncology Dr. Lori Pierce who are really trying to take us into a new way to think about how to manage our patients with the implementation of radiation therapy and so I want to make mention of that too it's not just drugs but also understanding that radiation can be now also potentially more tailored to patients because that's often a significant concern for our patients when they come in newly diagnosed and so it's really a dynamic time.  And we will provide I think at the end of the webcast a a series of links for people to be able to explore all the clinical trials that we offer. I think that would be very useful.  So again through prevention and screening and systemic therapy and surgery and reconstruction and radiation I think patients really need to be advocating for themselves, seeking information feeling confident of the fact that the information is there and coming to a place like Michigan where there is a center of excellence and people at the leading edge in all of these different fields who want nothing more than to provide care for patients who are in need for breast cancer and beyond.  Thank you so much. As we wrap up I always ask is there anything you feel that we've missed or do you have any final thoughts?  No, we're here for you. We serve the state of Michigan, tri-state area penta-state area, anywhere in the world if you are listening to us, please reach out to us. We're here to help prevent and treat cancer anywhere.  Never more than now is this the time of hope and optimism for hopefully identifying long-standing durable cure for this problem.  Fantastic. Well thank you both Dr. Jeruss and Dr. Merajver. Thank you for your time, your expertise. If you tuned in halfway through this video in it's entirety will be on our YouTube Twitter, Facebook properties. So once again thank you to our experts and thank you to our audience as well.  Thank you for tuning in  Thanks, yeah it was great. Thanks.  Thank you.  Yeah, thanks a lot.
